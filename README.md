## Skilled 🛢️Engineer on Data Analytics and Visualization 

👋 Hi there!!!👋  

I'm Petroleum Engineer (B Sc. and M Sc.) rocking over 5 years of experience in Energy scene, particulary shining in the ⛽ Oil & Gas and 🌏 Geothermal game. I'm your go-to guy for full-on asset wizardry🧙🏽, involving exploratory campaings to Production and abandonment stages, all from the perspective of reservoir and well performance.  

Skilled on day-to-day 👁️survelliance of wells and reservoirs. Analyzing fluids (🛢️ & 💧) production data and their trends, well's mechanical performances and reservoir behaviour & petrophysical porperties. 

I have become highly proficient in data modelling no matter its complexity. Involved in developing 🔢numerical and 🔬analytical modelling to 🔓unravel the stories hidden within the data across different ⏳time and space scales, 🎯aiming at evaluate current develompent strategies or breaking down 🧑🏽‍🔬engineering scenarios.

Expertise in docummenting and 📝reporting engineering and data analysis ⚒️workflows. Whether it's for stakeholders and senior leadership in a corporate environment or for academic research community.

### Transitioning to 📅Data/🧑🏽‍💼Business Analysis world!!!🌐 👈👈👈 ###

Embarking on a journey toward Data/Business analytic territories, I'm constantly fueled by improving in programming languages (🐍Python - MS Excel VBA and much more in the future🔮) and mastering BI tools (🖼️Tableau, just for now😁). I have translated these skills to perform in 📺TV 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦family entertainment industry and driving 👷🏽‍♂️🏬construction development projects. From database management to data processing/modeling to evaluate 🛒business strategies and extract data-driven insights to 💁🏽‍♂️support decision-making.

### 📃 Academic Papers ###
I have been involved in the generation of research papers related to describe the fluid flow in a porous media.

I modeled extraction of heat by Getohermal Doublets in naturally fractured reservoirs 
Conference Paper: Interplay of heat transport and fracture aperture in fractured reservoirs – 4th Naturally Fractured Reservoirs Workshop

I created a conceptual model to dig in the impact of mesh size over the simulation of water injection for oil recovery.
Conference Paper: Scale-Dependent Models for Modified Salinity Waterflooding – 82nd EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition, Netherlands

### 🎒 Education ###

Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering - Politecnico di Torino, Italy
Awarded with ToPolito Scholarship 2017/2019

Bachelor of Science Petroleum Engineering - Fundacion Universidad de América, Colombia
